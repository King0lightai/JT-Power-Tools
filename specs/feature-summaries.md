# JT Power Tools — Upcoming Features

## Team Notes
**Tier:** Power User
**Status:** In Planning

### Summary

Team Notes transforms Quick Notes from a personal scratchpad into a shared workspace for your entire company. Every note syncs across all devices and browsers, and notes can be linked to specific jobs so they appear automatically when you need them.

### The Problem

Important job information gets trapped in individual notepads, texts, and emails. When someone else takes over a job, that knowledge disappears. Teams waste time asking "did anyone write this down?"

### The Solution

A shared notes system that:
- **Syncs everywhere** — Same notes on desktop Chrome, mobile Edge, Firefox, any browser
- **Links to jobs** — Attach notes to specific jobs; they surface automatically when viewing that job
- **Shows attribution** — See who wrote what: "Gate code is 4421 — Mike, Jan 15"
- **Stays organized** — Group notes by topic: Job Handoffs, Site Info, Templates

### Use Cases

- **Job handoffs** — "Client prefers morning deliveries, gate code 4421"
- **Shared templates** — Standard scope language everyone can grab
- **Site info** — Access codes, contact numbers, parking notes
- **Vendor notes** — "Mike's Plumbing always runs 30 min late but does great work"
- **Team knowledge** — Tips and tricks that help everyone

### Why It Matters

One Power User license already covers your whole company. Team Notes makes that mean something — real collaboration without extra logins, apps, or switching tools.

## Schedule Assistant
**Tier:** Power User
**Status:** In Planning

### Summary

Schedule Assistant adds an "Unassigned Tasks" row to JobTread's Availability view, showing you what needs coverage right alongside who's available. No more switching screens to figure out what's unassigned.

### The Problem

JobTread's Availability view shows where your team IS assigned, but not what NEEDS assignment. To find unassigned tasks, you have to leave the view, search elsewhere, then come back. It's impossible to see the full picture in one place.

### The Solution

An intelligent task pool row that:
- **Shows unassigned tasks by day** — See what needs people at a glance
- **Filters by task type** — Labor, Time Off, Delivery, Inspections
- **Enables quick assignment** — Click a task, pick a team member, done
- **Updates in real-time** — Assigned tasks move from pool to the person's row

### How It Works

```
Before:                          After:
────────────────────             ────────────────────
         M   T   W               📋 TASK POOL  [Filter]
INTERNAL                                 M   T   W
Ben      ░   ░   █                      [2] [1] [3]
Sarah    ░   █   ░               INTERNAL
                                 Ben      ░   ░   █
❓ What needs coverage?          Sarah    ░   █   ░

                                 ✓ Full picture, one view
```

### Use Cases

- **Morning standup** — "What's uncovered today?" Instantly visible
- **Someone calls in sick** — See their tasks, reassign in seconds
- **Planning the week** — Balance workload across the team
- **Avoiding conflicts** — See who's already busy before assigning

### Why It Matters

Project managers spend hours juggling schedules across multiple screens. Schedule Assistant puts everything in one view, cutting coordination time and preventing tasks from falling through the cracks.

## Coming to Power User Tier

Both features leverage the JobTread API to deliver capabilities that JobTread itself doesn't offer. They're designed for teams who want to work smarter, not harder.

**Team Notes** — Your team's shared brain, right inside JobTread
**Schedule Assistant** — The full picture: tasks + availability in one view
