# JT Power Tools — Upcoming Features

## User Accounts
**Tier:** All Tiers (Foundation)
**Status:** In Planning

### Summary

User Accounts lets you create a personal login for Power Tools. After your initial setup with license and grant keys, just sign in with your email and password on any browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, mobile — and everything is there. No more re-entering keys on every device.

### The Problem

Every time you set up a new browser or device, you have to dig up your license key and grant key. Your notes and templates are stuck on one browser. If you use Chrome at the office and Edge on mobile, they're completely separate.

### The Solution

A simple account system that:
- **Stores your credentials securely** — Enter your keys once during setup, then just sign in
- **Works everywhere** — Same login on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Kiwi, any browser
- **Syncs your data** — Personal notes, templates, and settings follow you
- **Enforces licensing** — When the company license expires, everyone knows

### How It Works

**First time:**
1. Enter your license key → Verified
2. Enter your grant key → Connected to JobTread
3. Create account (email + password + display name)
4. Done — you're set up

**Every time after:**
1. Sign in with email and password
2. That's it — everything loads automatically

### Why It Matters

This is the foundation for everything else. Team Notes needs to know who you are. Cross-browser sync needs somewhere to store your data. User Accounts makes all of that possible while making setup simpler.

## Company Knowledge Base
**Tier:** Power User
**Status:** In Planning
**Requires:** User Accounts

### Summary

The Company Knowledge Base is your team's single source of truth for SOPs, procedures, vendor notes, and tips — the stuff that doesn't belong on any single job. Unlike JobTread's job notes, the Knowledge Base stores company-wide knowledge that applies everywhere.

### The Problem

Experienced employees know "how we do things" but that knowledge lives in their heads, scattered emails, or random Google Docs. New hires ask the same questions. Procedures are inconsistent. Nobody knows where to find the answer.

### The Solution

A searchable knowledge base that:
- **Lives inside JobTread** — No separate app, no extra login
- **Works on mobile** — Field workers can look up procedures on site
- **AI-powered search** — Ask questions in plain English
- **Always current** — Update once, everyone sees it
- **Offline capable** — Cache articles for jobsites with no signal

### What Goes Here (vs. JobTread)

| JobTread | Knowledge Base |
|----------|----------------|
| "Gate code is 4421" (job-specific) | "Always get signed change orders first" (company-wide) |
| Client phone number | "Mike's Plumbing runs late but does great work" |
| Job address | "Standard scope language for bathroom remodels" |

### Categories

- **Safety** — Lockout/tagout, fall protection, PPE requirements
- **Procedures** — Change orders, punch lists, warranty process
- **Vendor Notes** — Tips about subs, suppliers, inspectors
- **Templates** — Standard scope language, email templates
- **Tips & Tricks** — Best practices from experienced team members
- **Onboarding** — New employee resources

### Why It Matters

Stop losing institutional knowledge. Stop answering the same questions. Give your team — especially field workers — instant access to "how we do things" from any device.

With AI search, they can just ask: "How do I handle a change order?" and get the answer.

## Schedule Assistant
**Tier:** Power User
**Status:** In Planning
**Requires:** User Accounts

### Summary

Schedule Assistant adds an "Unassigned Tasks" row to JobTread's Availability view, showing you what needs coverage right alongside who's available. No more switching screens to figure out what's unassigned.

### The Problem

JobTread's Availability view shows where your team IS assigned, but not what NEEDS assignment. To find unassigned tasks, you have to leave the view, search elsewhere, then come back. It's impossible to see the full picture in one place.

### The Solution

An intelligent task pool row that:
- **Shows unassigned tasks by day** — See what needs people at a glance
- **Filters by task type** — Labor, Time Off, Delivery, Inspections
- **Enables quick assignment** — Click a task, pick a team member, done
- **Updates in real-time** — Assigned tasks move from pool to the person's row

### How It Works

```
Before:                          After:
────────────────────             ────────────────────
         M   T   W               📋 TASK POOL  [Filter]
INTERNAL                                 M   T   W
Ben      ░   ░   █                      [2] [1] [3]
Sarah    ░   █   ░               INTERNAL
                                 Ben      ░   ░   █
❓ What needs coverage?          Sarah    ░   █   ░

                                 ✓ Full picture, one view
```

### Use Cases

- **Morning standup** — "What's uncovered today?" Instantly visible
- **Someone calls in sick** — See their tasks, reassign in seconds
- **Planning the week** — Balance workload across the team
- **Avoiding conflicts** — See who's already busy before assigning

### Why It Matters

Project managers spend hours juggling schedules across multiple screens. Schedule Assistant puts everything in one view, cutting coordination time and preventing tasks from falling through the cracks.
