# JT Power Tools — Upcoming Features

## User Accounts
**Tier:** All Tiers (Foundation)
**Status:** In Planning

### Summary

User Accounts lets you create a personal login for Power Tools. After your initial setup with license and grant keys, just sign in with your email and password on any browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, mobile — and everything is there. No more re-entering keys on every device.

### The Problem

Every time you set up a new browser or device, you have to dig up your license key and grant key. Your notes and templates are stuck on one browser. If you use Chrome at the office and Edge on mobile, they're completely separate.

### The Solution

A simple account system that:
- **Stores your credentials securely** — Enter your keys once during setup, then just sign in
- **Works everywhere** — Same login on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Kiwi, any browser
- **Syncs your data** — Personal notes, templates, and settings follow you
- **Enforces licensing** — When the company license expires, everyone knows

### How It Works

**First time:**
1. Enter your license key → Verified
2. Enter your grant key → Connected to JobTread
3. Create account (email + password + display name)
4. Done — you're set up

**Every time after:**
1. Sign in with email and password
2. That's it — everything loads automatically

### Why It Matters

This is the foundation for everything else. Team Notes needs to know who you are. Cross-browser sync needs somewhere to store your data. User Accounts makes all of that possible while making setup simpler.

## Team Notes
**Tier:** Power User
**Status:** In Planning
**Requires:** User Accounts

### Summary

Team Notes transforms Quick Notes from a personal scratchpad into a shared workspace for your entire company. Every note syncs across all devices and browsers, and notes can be linked to specific jobs so they appear automatically when you need them.

### The Problem

Important job information gets trapped in individual notepads, texts, and emails. When someone else takes over a job, that knowledge disappears. Teams waste time asking "did anyone write this down?"

### The Solution

A shared notes system that:
- **Syncs everywhere** — Same notes on desktop Chrome, mobile Edge, Firefox, any browser
- **Links to jobs** — Attach notes to specific jobs; they surface automatically when viewing that job
- **Shows attribution** — See who wrote what: "Gate code is 4421 — Mike, Jan 15"
- **Stays organized** — Group notes by topic: Job Handoffs, Site Info, Templates

### Use Cases

- **Job handoffs** — "Client prefers morning deliveries, gate code 4421"
- **Shared templates** — Standard scope language everyone can grab
- **Site info** — Access codes, contact numbers, parking notes
- **Vendor notes** — "Mike's Plumbing always runs 30 min late but does great work"
- **Team knowledge** — Tips and tricks that help everyone

### Why It Matters

One Power User license already covers your whole company. Team Notes makes that mean something — real collaboration without extra logins, apps, or switching tools.

With User Accounts as the foundation, your personal notes also sync everywhere, while Team Notes give you shared spaces for collaboration.

## Schedule Assistant
**Tier:** Power User
**Status:** In Planning
**Requires:** User Accounts

### Summary

Schedule Assistant adds an "Unassigned Tasks" row to JobTread's Availability view, showing you what needs coverage right alongside who's available. No more switching screens to figure out what's unassigned.

### The Problem

JobTread's Availability view shows where your team IS assigned, but not what NEEDS assignment. To find unassigned tasks, you have to leave the view, search elsewhere, then come back. It's impossible to see the full picture in one place.

### The Solution

An intelligent task pool row that:
- **Shows unassigned tasks by day** — See what needs people at a glance
- **Filters by task type** — Labor, Time Off, Delivery, Inspections
- **Enables quick assignment** — Click a task, pick a team member, done
- **Updates in real-time** — Assigned tasks move from pool to the person's row

### How It Works

```
Before:                          After:
────────────────────             ────────────────────
         M   T   W               📋 TASK POOL  [Filter]
INTERNAL                                 M   T   W
Ben      ░   ░   █                      [2] [1] [3]
Sarah    ░   █   ░               INTERNAL
                                 Ben      ░   ░   █
❓ What needs coverage?          Sarah    ░   █   ░

                                 ✓ Full picture, one view
```

### Use Cases

- **Morning standup** — "What's uncovered today?" Instantly visible
- **Someone calls in sick** — See their tasks, reassign in seconds
- **Planning the week** — Balance workload across the team
- **Avoiding conflicts** — See who's already busy before assigning

### Why It Matters

Project managers spend hours juggling schedules across multiple screens. Schedule Assistant puts everything in one view, cutting coordination time and preventing tasks from falling through the cracks.
