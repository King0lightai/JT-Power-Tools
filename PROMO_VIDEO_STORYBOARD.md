---

## MOTION DESIGN LANGUAGE

### Animation Principles

1. **Snappy & Responsive** (150-300ms ease-out curves)
   - Mirrors the "hot toggle" instant-on feeling
   - No sluggish, floaty animations

2. **Industrial Precision**
   - Sharp movements, mechanical feel
   - Think: precision tools, not bouncy apps

3. **Orange Energy Trails**
   - Cursor movements leave subtle orange trails
   - Click points emit orange ripple effects

### Core Motion Elements

| Motion | Duration | Easing | Use |
|--------|----------|--------|-----|
| Fade In | 200ms | ease-out | Scene reveals |
| Slide In | 300ms | cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) | Feature panels |
| Scale Pop | 250ms | back-out | Icons, buttons |
| Wipe | 400ms | ease-in-out | Scene transitions |
| Bounce | 350ms | elastic | CTA moments |

### UI Recording Guidelines
- Record at 2x speed, playback at 1.5x (feels fast but readable)
- Add subtle zoom (105%) on feature interactions
- Use cursor highlight (orange ring) for click points
- Smooth scroll recordings (avoid jerky movements)

---

## TRANSITIONS

### Scene-to-Scene Transitions

1. **The Power Wipe** (Signature Transition)
   - Orange diagonal wipe with slight blur
   - 400ms duration
   - Use between major sections

2. **Zoom Through**
   - Camera zooms into UI element → new scene
   - Perfect for "let's look closer" moments

3. **Match Cut**
   - Same position element in two scenes
   - Example: Toggle switch → New feature enabled

4. **Particle Burst**
   - Orange particles explode outward
   - Use for "FREE" feature reveals

5. **Clean Cut**
   - Direct cut with audio cue
   - For rapid feature montage

### Micro-Transitions (Within Scenes)

- **Checkbox tick**: Scale pop + checkmark draws
- **Toggle flip**: 3D rotation with shadow
- **Panel slide**: Glass panel slides from edge
- **Text reveal**: Character-by-character with cursor

---

## MUSIC & SOUND DESIGN

### Music Style: **Modern Electronic / Tech Corporate**

**Vibe:** Confident, energetic, professional, forward-moving

**Reference Tracks:**
- Epidemic Sound: "Digital Momentum" style
- Artlist: "Tech Innovation" category

**BPM:** 110-125 (energetic but not frantic)

**Key Characteristics:**
- Clean synth pads (professional backdrop)
- Punchy drums on downbeats (for cut sync)
- Rising builds before feature reveals
- Satisfying drops on "FREE" and CTA moments

### Sound Effects Palette

| Feature Reveal | Rising shimmer | Anticipation |
| Checkbox Complete | Crisp "tick" | Achievement |
| Keyboard Shortcut | Mechanical key press | Power user |
| Scene Transition | Subtle woosh | Smooth momentum |
| CTA Button | Deep, confident thump | Call to action |
| Dark Mode Activate | Low electric hum | Transformation |

### Audio Sync Points
- Beat drop on "FREE" text
