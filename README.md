### How It Works

1. **Content Script** (`content.js`) loads on app.jobtread.com
2. **Feature Modules** are loaded dynamically based on user settings
3. **Popup UI** allows users to toggle features on/off
4. **Background Service Worker** manages settings and coordinates updates
5. **Chrome Storage API** persists settings across sessions

### Key Design Decisions

- **Modular Architecture**: Each feature is self-contained and can be enabled/disabled independently
- **Dynamic Loading**: Features are only loaded when enabled (performance optimization)
- **Hot Toggle**: Features can be toggled without page reload where possible
- **Separation of Concerns**: Settings, features, and UI are completely separate
- **Easy Updates**: Individual features can be updated without affecting others

## 🔧 Development

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Create feature module** in `features/new-feature.js`:
```javascript
const NewFeature = (() => {
  let isActive = false;

  function init() {
    isActive = true;
    // Your initialization code
  }

  function cleanup() {
    isActive = false;
    // Your cleanup code
  }

  return {
    init,
    cleanup,
    isActive: () => isActive
  };
})();

window.NewFeature = NewFeature;
```

2. **Register in content.js**:
```javascript
const featureModules = {
  // ... existing features
  newFeature: {
    name: 'New Feature',
    scriptPath: 'features/new-feature.js',
    instance: null,
    loaded: false
  }
};
```

3. **Add to popup UI** (`popup/popup.html`):
```html
<div class="feature-item">
  <div class="feature-info">
    <div class="feature-icon">🆕</div>
    <div class="feature-details">
      <h3>New Feature</h3>
      <p>Description of your feature</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <label class="toggle">
    <input type="checkbox" id="newFeature" data-feature="newFeature">
    <span class="slider"></span>
  </label>
</div>
```

4. **Update manifest** if needed (web accessible resources, permissions, etc.)

### Testing

1. Make changes to your code
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Click the **Reload** button on the JT Power Tools extension
4. Test on JobTread

### Debugging

- Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
- Check the **Console** tab for logs
- All features log their status with prefixes like `DragDrop:`, `ContrastFix:`, etc.
- Use `chrome://extensions` to view background service worker logs
